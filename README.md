A simple and useful value converter between number systems.

## ‚ñ∂ What does it do?
`Conv` lets you easily convert between **hex**, **dec**, **bin**, and **oct** number formats.

## ‚ñ∂ How to use?
It's super simple! Just run:

```bash
conv -<type> <value> -to_<type>
```

You can also use it as library!

```rs
fn main() {
    let value = conv::convert("A", "hex", "dec").unwrap();
    println!("Converted value: {}", value); // Output: Converted value: 10
}
```

## ‚ñ∂ For example:
```bash
# I want to convert hex A to decimal
conv -hex A -to_dec
# Output: 10
# You can also use -to_all to get all translations.
```
